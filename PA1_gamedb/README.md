# GameDB

## Installation:
The project is a standard Python package, and can be installed with `pip install .` or `python3 setup.py install`.

## Usage:
Invoke the entrypoint with `gamedb` once installed, or the module with `python3 -m gamedb`.
The latter command works even without having installed the package.
